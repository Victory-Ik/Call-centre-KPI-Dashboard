##  Overview
The **Call Center KPI Dashboard** provides actionable insights into call center performance, agent efficiency, and customer satisfaction. This dashboard enables call center managers to track key metrics and make data-driven decisions to improve operations and enhance customer experience.

##  Problem Statement
Call centers handle thousands of interactions daily, making it crucial to monitor agent performance and service quality. This dashboard helps:
- Identify areas needing improvement in customer satisfaction.
- Analyze average call handling and resolution times.
- Track agent efficiency and workload distribution.
- Detect patterns in call volume and peak hours to optimize staffing.

##  Key Insights
-  **Average Handling Time (AHT)**: Insights into call duration trends.
-  **Agent Performance Metrics**: Productivity and efficiency evaluation.
-  **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**: Rating trends from post-call surveys.
-  **Call Resolution Time**: How quickly issues are resolved.
-  **Call Trends & Peak Hours**: Identifying high-traffic periods for resource optimization.

##  Steps Followed in Power BI Development

### **Step 1: Data Preparation**
- Imported call center dataset (CSV file).
- Used Power Query to clean and preprocess data.
- Checked for null values and applied necessary transformations.

### **Step 2: Data Exploration**
- Enabled **Column Quality, Distribution, and Profile** in Power Query Editor.
- Verified missing values; handled NULLs in **Call Resolution Time** and **Customer Ratings** fields.

### **Step 3: KPI Calculation & DAX Measures**
- **Agent Utilization Rate** = `(Total Talk Time / Available Time) * 100`
- **Average Handling Time (AHT)** = `Total Call Duration / Number of Calls`
- **First Call Resolution (FCR)** = `Resolved Calls on First Attempt / Total Calls`
- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)** = `Average(Customer Ratings)`
